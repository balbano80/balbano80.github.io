                <p>I was born in Oakland, Ca.  I currently reside in San Ramon, Ca.  I am a <strong>HUGE</strong> Golden State Warriors fan,
                    and while not quite as big, am also a fan of the San Jose Sharks.
                </p>

                <p>I decided to take the Computer Science courses a couple years ago, because my brother had recently graduated with a Bachelor's
                    degree in Math and a minor in Computer Science.  He is currently working as QA for a startup Data Storage company(Cohesity)
                    His girlfriend was working on her degree in Computer Engineering and is currently working on her Master's.  At their suggestion, 
                    I decided to take the introductory course, and I enjoyed learning about, as well as using the logic to create and troubleshoot programs.    
                </p>

                <p> And now I am currently enrolled in the UC Berkeley Extension Coding/Web Development Bootcamp program.  I took a few Computer Science
                    courses(Intro, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures) at a local Community College, which the instructed language
                    was C++.  I recently did do some tinkering into JavaScript.  I did have some problems grasping some of the higher order functions,
                    that mostly dealed with array manipulation such as map, filter, and reduce.  I also did a little bit of basic testing with 
                    JS Koans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    (Filler paragraph to show text wraparound)  Why do we use Lorem Ipsum?
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point 
                    of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
                    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
                    and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
                    sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
